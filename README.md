This file a final project where I prove the Donsker Theorem. I use tools of weak convergence and measure theory in spaces like the metric space of continuous 
functions. The purpose was to write a clear proof of this important theorem that could be seen as a generalization of famous Central Limit Theorem. 

In this document a create a latex template that could help to someone else.
